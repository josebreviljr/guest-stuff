# Guest Mac Setup Script

This repository contains a lightweight, no-dependencies, macOS-native bash script that configures any guest or public Mac for quick use — and then restores it back to its original state when you're done.

The goal:  
**Curl → Run → Work → Restore → Leave No Trace**

## Features

### **Setup Mode (`setup`)**
- Installs **Firefox** automatically if it is not already installed.
- Opens login tabs for:
  - Google  
  - Blackboard  
  - GitHub  
- Reconfigures the Dock to show only:
  - Finder (macOS default)
  - Firefox  
  - Microsoft Word  
  - Microsoft PowerPoint  
  - Microsoft Excel  
  - Adobe Acrobat (or Acrobat Reader)
- **Backs up the current Dock configuration** so it can be restored later.

### **Restore Mode (`restore`)**
- Wipes all personal Firefox data for the current user:
  - Profiles  
  - Cache  
  - Preferences  
- Restores the Dock to its **original** layout using the backup created during setup.

### **Zero external packages**
The script uses only built-in macOS tools:
`bash`, `curl`, `hdiutil`, `defaults`, `killall`, `rm`, `open`.

No Homebrew, no dockutil, no third-party software.
